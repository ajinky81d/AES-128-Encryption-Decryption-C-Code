How to run : any online IDE of C++ or Installed Software.
Link for IDE : https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/

Work Flow : 
1. Run Encryption.cpp on Online IDE.
2. Give the input and note the cipher text created.
3. Run Decryption.cpp in new tab.
4. Enter cipher text and same key
5. You will get the same text you inserted.
6. Test online test case for AES-128 availble on StackOverflow.

The Encryption Code :      
Input  : key and a plain or hex text.
Output : cipher text

Decryption Code :
Input : Cipher text generated at Output of Encryption and Same Key use at encryption.
output : A text which is intially encrypted.

Check ESP32 Simulation for same : https://wokwi.com/projects/443713127353027585
About ESP32 - Just converted the cpp code in compatible ESP code, check the same fuctionality on using serial monitor.
